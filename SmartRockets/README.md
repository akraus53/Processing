# Oh, hi!
It seems you found my little Processing Port of **Daniel Shiffmans Coding Challenge**

## Tiny Changelog
- This is a direct port of the **P5.js** code he created in the video
- I modified it a bit and thought about a way to make the genetic aspect more visual 
- I changed the fitness function
- The path is more complicated now because there are two barriers
